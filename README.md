This repo contains a [Mediator](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/concepts/0046-mediators-and-relays/README.md) Agent for usage with [Hyperledger Aries and DIDComm v1 agents](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/concepts/0004-agents). It is built using [Credo](https://github.com/openwallet-foundation/credo-ts).

Why should you use this mediator?

- Automatically set up mediation with the mediator using the [Mediator Coordination Protocol](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/features/0211-route-coordination).
- Pick up messages implicitly using WebSockets, using the [Pickup V1 Protocol](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/features/0212-pickup), and the [Pickup V2 Protocol](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/features/0685-pickup-v2).
- Configured to persist queued messages for recipient in a postgres.
- Use the pre-built docker image for easy deployment of your mediator.

## Connecting to the Mediator

When you've correctly started the mediator agent, and have extracted the invitation from the console, you can use the invitation to connect to the mediator agent. To connect to the mediator and start receiving messages, there's a few steps that need to be taken:

1. Connect to the mediator from another agent using the created [Out Of Band Invitation](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/features/0434-outofband/README.md)
2. Request mediation from the mediator using the [Mediator Coordination Protocol](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/features/0211-route-coordination).
3. Start picking up messages implicitly by connecting using a WebSocket and sending any DIDComm message to authenticate, the [Pickup V1 Protocol](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/features/0212-pickup), or the [Pickup V2 Protocol](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/features/0685-pickup-v2). We recommend using the Pickup V2 Protocol.

If you're using an Credo agent as the client, you can follow the [Mediation Tutorial](https://credo.js.org/guides/tutorials/mediation) from the Credo docs.

## Development

The mediator can be configured to use different storage backends for various components. During development, you can easily switch between these options by modifying your environment configuration.

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. Modify the existing `.env.development` file to configure your preferred storage options:

   - Database storage (SQLite or Postgres)
   - Message pickup storage (Credo or DynamoDB)
   - Cache storage (In-memory or Redis)

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

### Using Docker Compose for External Dependencies

The project includes a Docker Compose file with services for external dependencies. You can selectively start only the services you need based on your configuration:

```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up

# Or start individual services as needed
docker-compose up postgres
docker-compose up redis
docker-compose up dynamodb
```

For example:

- If using Postgres for database storage, start the Postgres service
- If using Redis for caching, start the Redis service
- If using DynamoDB for message pickup, start the DynamoDB service

### External Access

To reach the mediator from external devices or for testing with mobile apps, set up an ngrok tunnel.

Read more on setting up your ngrok tunnel here: https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started.

Make sure to set the `AGENT_HOSTS` environment variable when running the dev script:

```
AGENT_HOSTS=https://652a89f3d681.ngrok-free.app,wss://652a89f3d681.ngrok-free.app pnpm dev
```

## Configuration

The mediator can be configured using **environment variables** or a **JSON configuration file**. All configuration options are available via both methods, and you can use the provided sample files for quick setup.

### 1. Environment Variables

- All configuration options can be set via environment variables.
- Environment variables must be written in upper case. (ASKAR instead of askar)
- Nested config options use double underscores (`__`) for nesting. For example:
  - `ASKAR__STORE_ID=test`
  - `MESSAGE_PICKUP__STORAGE__TYPE=postgres`
  - `CACHE__TYPE=redis`
  - `CACHE__REDIS_URL=redis://127.0.0.1:6379`
- See the [Configuration Reference](#configuration-reference) below for all available options and their ENV names.

You can also provide the following environment variables, these CANNOT be provided in the JSON configuration, as they are Node environment variables.

| Environment Variable | Description                                                                                                                              |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NODE_OPTIONS`       | Options to pass to Node.js runtime. We recommend setting this to `--max-old-space-size=512` to limit the memory usage of the agent.      |
| `MALLOC_CONF`        | Options to pass to the memory allocator. We recommend setting this to `background_thread:true,metadata_thp:auto` to improve performance. |
| `LD_PRELOAD`         | Preload the jemalloc memory allocator. We recommend setting this to `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libjemalloc.so.2` to improve performance. |

### 2. JSON Configuration File

- You can provide a JSON config file and point to it with the `CONFIG` environment variable:
  ```sh
  CONFIG=apps/mediator/samples/full.json pnpm dev
  ```
- See the [`apps/mediator/samples/`](apps/mediator/samples/) directory for example config files:
  - `simple.json`: Minimal config (just Askar storeId/storeKey)
  - `simple-defaults.json`: Minimal config with all defaults
  - `full.json`: All options enabled (Postgres, Redis, DynamoDB, etc.)
  - `cache-in-memory.json`, `cache-redis.json`: Cache backend examples
  - `message-pickup-credo.json`, `message-pickup-dynamodb.json`, `message-pickup-postgres.json`, `message-pickup-cosmosdb.json`: Message pickup storage examples
  - `storage-askar-sqlite.json`, `storage-askar-postgres.json`, `storage-drizzle-sqlite.json`, `storage-drizzle-postgres.json`: Storage backend examples
  - `aws.json`: Full AWS deployment example with DynamoDB
  - `azure.json`: Full Azure deployment example with Cosmos DB

### Configuration Reference

Below are the top-level configuration options. All can be set via ENV (with double underscores for nesting) or in a JSON config file.

#### Askar Database

- `database.type`: `sqlite` or `postgres`
- For `postgres`, also set: `host`, `user`, `password`, `adminUser`, `adminPassword`

#### Drizzle Storage

- `dialect`: `sqlite` or `postgres`
- `databaseUrl`: Connection string

##### Running Drizzle Migrations

When using Drizzle storage it is important to run database migrations before deploying your mediator. The migrations are SQL files that define the structure of your database and handle changes to Credo's data structure over time. You can do this on every deployment, or only when migrations have changed. We recommend to continuously run migrations when deploying, so you're always up to date with the latest migrations from Credo and the mediator.

You can run migrations using the provided PNPM scripts in the `apps/mediator` directory:

- `pnpm drizzle:migrate:postgres`
- `pnpm drizzle:migrate:sqlite`

Make sure to provide the `DRIZZLE_DATABASE_URL` environment variable when running this migration.

If you're using the provided Docker image, you can reuse the same image to run migrations. In this scenario for each deployment you will run two docoker containers based on the same image. One for the migration which will exit quickly, and one long-running container for the mediator. The mediator container will be dependant on the migration container.

When running migrations from the docker container make sure to set:

- Entrypoint to `["sh", "-c"]`
- Command to `pnpm --filter didcomm-mediator-service run drizzle:migrate:postgres` (or `:sqlite`)
- The `DRIZZLE_DATABASE_URL`

##### Migrating from Askar

If you're migrating from an Askar database to a drizzle database you first need to run the Drizzle migraiton. You can do this by running the provided PNPM script: `pnpm migrate-askar-to-drizzle` from the `apps/mediator` directory. Note you still need to keep Askar for the KMS, and thus you can't fully migrate away from Askar. When you have succesfully migrated (make sure to verify this!) you can remove the storage records from Askar using the `pnpm migrate-askar-to-drizzle-delete-storage-records` command from the `apps/mediator` directory.

Make sure to:

- Provide the same configuration you'd provide to the mediator
- Provide the aksar configuration
- Configure Drizzle storage to be used
- Backup your database beforehand.

If you're using the provided Docker image, you can reuse the same image to migrate from Askar to Drizzle Storage. This migration only has to be run once before running your mediator container configured with Drizzle as the storage type.

When running the Askar to Drizzle migration from the docker container make sure to set:

- Entrypoint to `["sh", "-c"]`
- Command to `pnpm --filter didcomm-mediator-service run migrate-askar-to-drizzle`
  - To avoid using `pnpm` in a docker container, it may be desired to run the node command directly: `node apps/mediator migrate-askar-to-drizzle`
- Environment variables and configuration options as you'd use with the mediator container

When running the Askar to Drizzle storage delettion after successul migration from the docker container make sure to set:

- Entrypoint to `["sh", "-c"]`
- Command to `pnpm --filter didcomm-mediator-service run migrate-askar-to-drizzle-delete-storage-records`
  - To avoid using `pnpm` in a docker container, it may be desired to run the node command directly: `node apps/mediator/build/askarToDrizzleDeleteAskarStorageRecords.js`
- Environment variables and configuration options as you'd use with the mediator container

#### Cache

- `type`: `in-memory` or `redis`
- For `redis`, set `redisUrl`

#### Message Pickup

- `forwardingStrategy`: `DirectDelivery`, `QueueOnly`, `QueueAndLiveModeDelivery`. The `DirectDelivery` strategy will deliver messages directly to the recipient, while the `QueueOnly` strategy will only queue the messages for the recipient. The `QueueAndLiveModeDelivery` strategy will queue the messages for the recipient and deliver them directly if possible. The default is `DirectDelivery`.
- `storage.type`: `credo`, `postgres`, `dynamodb`, or `cosmosdb`
  - For `postgres`: `host`, `user`, `password`, `database`
  - For `dynamodb`: `region`, `accessKeyId`, `secretAccessKey`, `tableName` (AWS)
  - For `cosmosdb`: `endpoint`, `key`, `databaseName`, `containerName` (Azure)
- `multiInstanceDelivery.type`: `none` or `redis`.
  - `none`. In this case multi instance delivery is not enabled. Use this if you're using `postgres` for `messagePickup.storage.type`, or if only deploying a single instance.
  - For `redis`: You MUST also use `redis` for `cache.type` in this case. The redis URL will be extracted from the cache configuration. The `redis` multi instance delivery uses Redis streams, ensuring consistent delivery and handling of underliverd messages.

#### Push Notifications

- `webhookUrl`: URL for webhook notifications. If configured a webhook will be sent to the `webhookUrl` for all messages that are queued and could not be delivered directly (also taking into account multi-instance delivery). If an FCM device token is known for the connection, it will be included in the webhook body.
- `firebase`: `{ projects: [{ projectId, clientEmail, privateKey }], notificationTitle, notificationBody }`. Allows sending push notifications directly using Firebase Cloud Messaging.

An example of a webhook sent to the `webhookUrl` is:

```json
{
  "connectionId": "95825e8e-1cb4-455a-a61a-5d8e37c2b929",
  "fcmToken": "<token>"
}
```

#### Example: ENV vs JSON

**ENV:**

```sh
ASKAR__STORE_ID=test \
ASKAR__STORE_KEY=test \
CACHE__TYPE=redis \
CACHE__REDIS_URL=redis://127.0.0.1:6379 \
MESSAGE_PICKUP__STORAGE__TYPE=dynamodb \
MESSAGE_PICKUP__STORAGE__REGION=local \
MESSAGE_PICKUP__STORAGE__ACCESS_KEY_ID=local \
MESSAGE_PICKUP__STORAGE__TABLE_NAME=queued_messages \
MESSAGE_PICKUP__STORAGE__SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=local \
pnpm dev
```

**JSON:**

```json
{
  "askar": {
    "storeId": "test",
    "storeKey": "test"
  },
  "cache": {
    "type": "redis",
    "redisUrl": "redis://127.0.0.1:6379"
  },
  "messagePickup": {
    "storage": {
      "type": "dynamodb",
      "region": "local",
      "accessKeyId": "local",
      "secretAccessKey": "local"
    }
  }
}
```

For more examples, see the [`apps/mediator/samples/`](apps/mediator/samples/) directory.

## Using Docker

You can run the mediator using Docker with either environment variables or a JSON config file. For example:

**Using ENV:**

```sh
docker run \
  -e "ASKAR__STORE_ID=test" \
  -e "ASKAR__STORE_KEY=test" \
  -e "CACHE__TYPE=redis" \
  -e "CACHE__REDIS_URL=redis://127.0.0.1:6379" \
  -e "MESSAGE_PICKUP__STORAGE__TYPE=dynamodb" \
  -e "MESSAGE_PICKUP__STORAGE__REGION=local" \
  -e "MESSAGE_PICKUP__STORAGE__ACCESS_KEY_ID=local" \
  -e "MESSAGE_PICKUP__STORAGE__SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=local" \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  ghcr.io/openwallet-foundation/didcomm-mediator-credo/mediator:latest
```

**Using a JSON config file:**

```sh
docker run \
  -e "CONFIG=/config/full.json" \
  -v $(pwd)/apps/mediator/samples/full.json:/config/full.json \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  ghcr.io/openwallet-foundation/didcomm-mediator-credo/mediator:latest
```

You can also adapt the `apps/mediator/docker-compose.yml` file to your needs.

## Roadmap

The contents in this repository started out as a simple mediator built using Credo that can be used for development. Over time we've added some features, but there's still a lot we want to add to this repository over time. Some things on the roadmap:

- Expose a `did:web` did, so you can directly connect to the mediator using only a did
- DIDComm v2 support
- Allow to control acceptance of mediation requests

## 🖇️ How To Contribute
